I am a Statistician and currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the Shah Lab for Computational Cancer Biology at the [BC Cancer Agency Research Centre](https://bccrc.ca). I completed my PhD in Statistics at the [University of British Columbia (UBC)](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/) under the supervision of Nancy Heckman. I am originally from Brazil where I received my Master's and Bachelor's Degrees both in Statistics at the University of Campinas. My main research areas of interest include method development and analysis of  genomic data, nonparametric regression, functional data analysis, density estimation, machine learning, latent variable modelling and applications to energy consumption data.
