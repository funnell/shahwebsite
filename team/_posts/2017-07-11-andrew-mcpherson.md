I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine](http://pathology.ubc.ca) at [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca).  I am interested in understanding how tumour cells evolve in response to the immune system and cancer treatment, with the aim of improving treatment options.  I currently work on the development of computational methods and infrastructure for single cell genome sequencing, with the intention of applying these methods to patient samples and derived xenografts.
