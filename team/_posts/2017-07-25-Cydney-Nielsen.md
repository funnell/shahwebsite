I am a Research Associate at the [University of British Columbia](http://www.ubc.ca/) working in the [Shah Lab for Computational Cancer Biology](http://compbio.bccrc.ca/) based at the [British Columbia Cancer Agency](http://www.bccancer.bc.ca/).
I completed my PhD in computational biology at [MIT](http://www.mit.edu/) and postdoctoral fellowship at the [Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre](http://www.bcgsc.ca/). My current work focuses on developing data visualization techniques and collaboratively applying them to answer pressing questions in genomics.
